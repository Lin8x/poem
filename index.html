    <h1>What I Do With the Rope</h1>
    <p>
      When you died, the world stayed still.
But only for me,life had its will.
No breakdown came, no final note.
Just silence,and this fraying rope.

You didn’t talk the way some dads do,
but you showed me strength in what you knew.
In fixing sinks, in hands that stay,
in work that spoke what words can’t say.

I sit where you’d sit, out in the breeze,
where sunlight leans through bending trees.
You used to close your eyes and rest.
I thought it strange,now I think it’s best.

You didn’t preach, you didn’t teach
with loud advice or out-of-reach
philosophies I’d never hold.
You showed me calm. You built. You told
the world with roads, with gardens grown.
Now I stand, half-built, alone.

This rope you left,it isn’t neat.
It knots itself beneath my feet.
It drags through days I barely try.
It tightens fast when I ask why.

I still go eat at spots we knew,
though nothing there still tastes like you.
I fish alone. I feel the air.
I hope you’d say you’d still be there.

Grief doesn’t shout,it just repeats.
It lives in silence, in empty seats.
It hums behind my every move,
a song that doesn’t seek to soothe.

Still, I wake. I try. I cope.
I twist new threads into this rope.
It’s made of things you left behind,
of hands, and work, and staying kind.

It frays, it sags, it hurts my grip.
But I won’t let this fabric slip.
Because in this rope, I feel you near,
and pulling forward
keeps you here.
