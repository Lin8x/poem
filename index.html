    <h1>The Version of Me That Died First</h1>
    <p>
      I was softer then.
Before silence filled the shape of your voice.
Before nights made everything louder.
Before the boy you knew
had to become something else
just to survive waking up.

You died,
and I didn’t.
But something inside me did.
And I don’t know what to call it
except before.

I used to laugh without checking.
Speak without rehearsing.
Move without hearing
that whisper that says—
you’re not safe here.
You’re not enough anymore.

Grief doesn’t just take.
It remakes.

I see it in my reflection,
how I’ve grown
into someone you wouldn’t recognize.
Not because I’ve changed,
but because you’re not here
to remember me
the way I was
when I was still innocent,
still brave,
still whole.

I walk through our house
like it’s been abandoned by time.
Everything remains—
the couches, the frames,
even mom’s voice,
still warm, still trying—
but I feel like a ghost
passing through comfort
like it’s made of glass.

I want to go back.
But even if I could,
I’d ruin it
just by knowing
what’s coming.

Some mornings I wake
and feel nothing.
Not pain,
not healing—
just the dull gravity
of another day survived.

I wonder if you’d be proud.
Of how I keep moving.
Of how I still eat at places we used to go,
even when the booths feel haunted
and the food tastes like silence.

There are no more words left between us.
Just the way I sit in your absence,
quietly.
How I carry the past
like a backpack full of sand—
never visible,
but always heavy.

But still, I wake.
And I act.
And I love.

Not because the weight is gone,
but because there’s something
in choosing to carry it—
in making something
from what remains.
That is not peace.
It’s not even hope.
But it’s forward.

And maybe that
is enough.
